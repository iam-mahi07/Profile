Hello! Iâ€™m Mahender Jangam ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my GitHub profile!
Success isn't achieved in an overnight because it involves numerous sleepless nights, failures, countless hours of hardwork and learnings!
I truly believe that the key to succeess is, consistent learning, commiting mistakes, failing and, do not to repeat the same mistake next time and consistent improvement leads to a miracle.
  
I'm a professional with nearly 4.5 years of work experience and a 1.5 years of relevant experience in DevOps and Cloud. 
Here comes the technical stack that would give an idea about my expertise.
I'm specialized in designing and implementing robust CI/CD pipelines, managing containerized applications, and optimizing cloud infrastructure to drive efficiency and scalability. My technical expertise spans across AWS services, including EC2, S3, IAM, VPC, and EKS, with a focus on using Terraform, Jenkins, Docker, and Kubernetes to streamline operations and enhance performance.
Moreover, my strong project management abilities ensure successful project delivery within scope, timeline, and budget. I thrive in collaborative environments, excelling in cross-functional team collaboration and effective communication.
Feel free to explore my repositories to see some of the projects Iâ€™ve worked on and check out my code. If youâ€™d like to connect, collaborate, or chat about DevOps and cloud technologies, donâ€™t hesitate to reach out!
