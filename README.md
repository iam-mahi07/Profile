Hello! Iâ€™m Mahender Jangam ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub profile!

Success isnâ€™t achieved overnightâ€”it comes from countless sleepless nights, failures, and endless hours of hard work and learning. I firmly believe that success is built on constant learning, making and correcting mistakes, and striving for continuous improvement. Itâ€™s through this journey that we achieve remarkable results!


I bring nearly 4.5 years of professional experience, with 1.5 years dedicated to DevOps and Cloud. My journey has equipped me with a deep understanding of:

- CI/CD Pipelines: Designing and implementing robust pipelines to streamline development and deployment processes.
- Container Management: Managing containerized applications using Docker and Kubernetes.
- Cloud Infrastructure: Optimizing cloud environments with AWS services such as EC2, S3, IAM, VPC, and EKS.
- Infrastructure as Code: Utilizing Terraform for efficient and scalable infrastructure management.
- Monitoring and Performance: Leveraging tools to ensure high performance and reliability.
  
In addition to my technical skills, I am developing my project management skills to support successful project delivery within scope, timeline, and budget. I thrive in collaborative environments, working seamlessly with cross-functional teams and communicating effectively.

Feel free to explore my repositories to see the projects Iâ€™ve worked on and review my code. If youâ€™d like to connect, collaborate, or discuss DevOps and cloud technologies, please reach out!
